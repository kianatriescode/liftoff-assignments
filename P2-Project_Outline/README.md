## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My web app is called “dUeDaTes” it will be a calendar app that will allow my students (Geometry Teacher) to keep track of all assignments, readings, projects, and other life events.  Users will find it useful in that it will help them be more organized and better prepared for quizzes and district exams.  I noticed a need in my classroom amongst my students and it was organization.  I believe that if students used this app to help them stay organized that it can improve comprehension of the material in their courses and ultimately their grades.
